# Hardhat Network Reference

- It supports the following hardforks:
  - byzantium
  - constantinople
  - petersburg
  - istanbul
  - muirGlacier

## Config

- Default behavior: Hardhat will automatically run in-process when `defaultNetwork` is empty or set to `hardhat`.

### Mining modes

<!-- TODO: add a link to the explanation of mining modes -->

You can configure the mining behavior under your Hardhat Network settings:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    mining: {
      auto: false,
      interval: 5000
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, automining is disabled and interval mining is set so that a new block is generated every 5 seconds. You can also configure interval mining to generate a new block after a random delay:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    mining: {
      auto: false,
      interval: [3000, 6000]
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, a new block will be mined after a random delay of between 3 and 6 seconds. For example, the first block could be mined after 4 seconds, the second block 5.5 seconds after that, and so on.

#### Manual mining

You can disable both mining modes like this:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    mining: {
      auto: false,
      interval: 0
    }
  }
}
```

This means that no new blocks will be mined by the Hardhat Network, but you can manually mine new blocks using the `evm_mine` RPC method. This will generate a new block that will include as many pending transactions as possible.

### Mempool behavior

When automine is disabled, every sent transaction is added to the mempool, which contains all the transactions that could be mined in the future. Hardhat Network's mempool follows the same rules as geth. This means, among other things, that:

- Transactions with a higher gas price are included first
- If two transactions can be included and both have the same gas price, the one that was received first is included first
- If a transaction is invalid (for example, its nonce is lower than the nonce of the address that sent it), the transaction is dropped.

You can get the list of pending transactions that will be included in the next block by using the "pending" block tag:

```js
const pendingBlock = await network.provider.send("eth_getBlockByNumber", [
  "pending",
  false,
]);
```

### Removing and replacing transactions

Transactions in the mempool can be removed using the `hardhat_dropTransaction` method:

```js
const txHash = "0xabc...";
await network.provider.send("hardhat_dropTransaction", [txHash]);
```

You can also replace a transaction by sending a new one with the same nonce as the one that it's already in the mempool but with a higher gas price. Keep in mind that, like in Geth, for this to work the new gas price has to be at least 10% higher than the gas price of the current transaction.

### Configuring mining modes using RPC methods

You can change the mining behavior on runtime using two RPC methods: `evm_setAutomine` and `evm_setIntervalMining`. For example, to disable automining:

```js
await network.provider.send("evm_setAutomine", [false]);
```

And to enable interval mining:

```js
await network.provider.send("evm_setIntervalMining", [5000]);
```

## `console.log`

- You can use it in calls and transactions. It works with `view` functions, but not in `pure` ones.
- It always works, regardless of the call or transaction failing or being successful.
- To use it you need to import `hardhat/console.sol`.
- You can call `console.log` with up to 4 parameters in any order of following types:
  - `uint`
  - `string`
  - `bool`
  - `address`
- There's also the single parameter API for the types above, and additionally `bytes`, `bytes1`... up to `bytes32`:
  - `console.logInt(int i)`
  - `console.logUint(uint i)`
  - `console.logString(string memory s)`
  - `console.logBool(bool b)`
  - `console.logAddress(address a)`
  - `console.logBytes(bytes memory b)`
  - `console.logBytes1(bytes1 b)`
  - `console.logBytes2(bytes2 b)`
  - ...
  - `console.logBytes32(bytes32 b)`
- `console.log` implements the same formatting options that can be found in Node.js' [`console.log`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/console.html#console_console_log_data_args), which in turn uses [`util.format`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args).
  - Example: `console.log("Changing owner from %s to %s", currentOwner, newOwner)`
- `console.log` is implemented in standard Solidity and then detected in Hardhat Network. This makes its compilation work with any other tools (like Remix, Waffle or Truffle).
- `console.log` calls can run in other networks, like mainnet, kovan, ropsten, etc. They do nothing in those networks, but do spend a minimal amount of gas.
- `console.log` output can also be viewed for testnets and mainnet via [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
- `console.log` works by sending static calls to a well-known contract address. At runtime, Hardhat Network detects calls to that address, decodes the input data to the calls, and writes it to the console.

## Initial State

Hardhat Network is initialized by default in this state:

- A brand new blockchain, just with the genesis block.
- 20 accounts with 10000 ETH each, generated with the mnemonic `"test test test test test test test test test test test junk"`. Their addresses are:
  - `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266`
  - `0x70997970C51812dc3A010C7d01b50e0d17dc79C8`

  "0x123...",
]);
```

You can also selectively disable some properties in the list of steps:

```js
const trace = await hre.network.provider.send("debug_traceTransaction", [
  "0x123...",
  {
    disableMemory: true,
    disableStack: true,
    disableStorage: true,
  },
]);
```

##### Known limitations

- The last step of a message is not guaranteed to have a correct value in the `gasCost` property

#### `evm_increaseTime`

same as Ganache.

#### `evm_mine`

same as Ganache

#### `evm_revert`

same as Ganache.

#### `evm_setAutomine`

Enables or disables, based on the single boolean argument, the automatic mining of new blocks with each new transaction submitted to the network.

#### `evm_setBlockGasLimit`

#### `evm_setIntervalMining`

Enables (with a numeric argument greater than 0) or disables (with a numeric argument equal to 0), the automatic mining of blocks at a regular interval of milliseconds, each of which will include all pending transactions.

#### `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp`

This method works like `evm_increaseTime`, but takes the exact timestamp that you want in the next block, and increases the time accordingly.

#### `evm_snapshot`

same as Ganache.

## Limitations

### Supported Solidity versions

Hardhat Network can run any smart contract, but it only understands Solidity 0.5.1 and newer.

If you are compiling with an older version of Solidity, or using another language, you can use Hardhat Network, but Solidity stack traces won't be generated.

### Solidity optimizer support

Hardhat Network can work with smart contracts compiled with optimizations, but this may lead to your stack traces' line numbers being a little off.

We recommend compiling without optimizations when testing and debugging your contracts.
